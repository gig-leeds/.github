The Geophysical Imaging Group (GIG) at the University of Leeds work on a broad area of applied seismology and geophysics. These include the development of methods to explore and characterise natural resources, monitoring geohazards, and understanding subsurface Earth processes from the scale of the critical zone (meters) to the crust (tens of km).
