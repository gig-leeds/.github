The Geophysical Imaging Group (<strong>G<sup>I</sup>G</strong>) at the University of Leeds works on a broad area of applied seismology and geophysics. These include the development of methods to explore and characterise natural resources, monitoring geohazards, and understanding subsurface Earth processes from the scale of the critical zone (meters) to the crust (tens of km's). Our name and logo reflect the fundamental equation underpinning the art of our trade: to infer from a set of observations of some physical phenomena the the underlying model properties that reveal how this phenomena works. <strong>G<sup>-1</sup></strong> means to invert some function <strong>G</strong> (e.g. a Green's function) in order to obtain an estimate of a model from some data <strong>d&nbsp;=&nbsp;G(m)</strong>, via <strong>G<sup>-1</sup>(m)G(m)&nbsp;&thickapprox;&nbsp;m</strong>.
