The Geophysical Imaging Group (GIG) at the University of Leeds works on a broad area of applied seismology and geophysics. These include the development of methods to explore and characterise natural resources, monitoring geohazards, and understanding subsurface Earth processes from the scale of the critical zone (meters) to the crust (tens of km's). Our logo reflects the fundamental equation underpinning the art of our trade: G<sup>-1</sup>G means to invert some function G (e.g. a Green's function) in order to infer from a set of observations, i.e. data: <strong>d=G(m)</strong>, the underlying model properties <strong>m</strong> that govern some physical phenomena, via: <strong>m&thickapprox;G<sup>-1</sup>(m)G(m)</strong>.
